# liri-node-app
Inspired by SIRI, Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface (LIRI) is a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data.

### Overview
LIRI is a command line node app that takes in search parameters, and using the `axios` and `spotify` npm packages, gives you back data retrieved from the following APIs:
    *[Bands In Town API](http://www.artists.bandsintown.com/bandsintown-api)
    *[Node-Spotify-API](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-spotify-api)
    *[OMDB](http://omdbapi.com/)
